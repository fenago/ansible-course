ERROR! 'msg' is not a valid attribute for a Task

The error appears to be in '/home/fale/ansible/Ansible2Cookbook/Ch11/syntaxcheck.yaml': line 4, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
    - debug:
      ^ here

This error can be suppressed as a warning using the "invalid_task_attribute_failed" configuration
