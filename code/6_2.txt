        Use the python ssh implementation (Paramiko) to connect to
        targets The paramiko transport is provided because many
        distributions, in particular EL6 and before do not support
        ControlPersist in their SSH implementations. This is needed on
        the Ansible control machine to be reasonably efficient with
        connections. Thus paramiko is faster for most users on these
        platforms. Users with ControlPersist capability can consider
        using -c ssh or configuring the transport in the configuration
        file. This plugin also borrows a lot of settings from the ssh
        plugin as they both cover the same protocol.
