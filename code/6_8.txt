    description:
        - This lookup returns the first character of the contents from a file on the Ansible controller's file system.
    options:
      _terms:
        description: path(s) of files to read
        required: True
    notes:
      - if read in variable context, the file can be interpreted as YAML if the content is valid to the parser.
      - this lookup does not understand 'globing', use the fileglob lookup instead.
