EC2 external inventory script
=================================

Generates inventory that Ansible can understand by making API request to
AWS EC2 using the Boto library.

NOTE: This script assumes Ansible is being executed where the environment
variables needed for Boto have already been set:
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK123'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'

Optional region environment variable if region is 'auto'

This script also assumes that there is an ec2.ini file alongside it. To specify
 a
different path to ec2.ini, define the EC2_INI_PATH environment variable:

    export EC2_INI_PATH=/path/to/my_ec2.ini
